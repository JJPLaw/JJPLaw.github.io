    <p>I'm Jack and this is my little website. Here I'm going to post some of my data visualisation (and possibly art) projects.</p>
    <p>I received my PhD in Biology from the University of York in 2021, during which I found a passion for data visualisation while trying to figure out what my bacteria were up to. I got started with wrangling, analysing and visualising using R, particularly the tidyverse suite of packages, and I'm currently learning about d3.js.</p>
    <p>One of the parts I most enjoy about data visualisation is making them aesthetically pleasing, and to work on improving my aesthetic sensibilities I am also learning about graphic design. I may include some generative art here as well—which I've been known to dabble in—depending on how the mood takes me.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, I listen to a lot of music (the subject of my first big visualisation here), watch a lot of films, and like indoor bouldering and baking sourdough.</p>
