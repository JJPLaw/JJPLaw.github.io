    <p>I'm Jack and this is my little website. Here I'm going to post my data visualisation projects, and the behind the scenes work that went into realising these projects.</p>

    <p>Following a 2-year stint as a medical writer, I've found that I would like my career to involve more work in visual communication and data storytelling, and I aim for the projects that I publish here to showcase my skills and continued development.
    </p>

    <p>I received my PhD in Biology from the University of York in 2021. During my PhD I found a passion for data visualisation while trying to figure out what my bacteria were doing after being to various experiments. I got started with wrangling, analysing, and visualising using R, particularly the tidyverse suite of packages. To expand my toolkit, I'm currently learning about D3.js, with a view toward exploring other visualisation tools in the future.</p>

    <p>One of the parts I most enjoy about making data visualisations is making them aesthetically pleasing (there's nothing worse than a boring-looking graph), and to work on improving my aesthetic sensibilities I am also learning about graphic design. I may include some generative art (which I've been known to dabble in) here as well, depending on how the mood takes me.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, I listen to a lot of music (the subject of my first big visualisation here), watch a lot of films, and like indoor bouldering and baking sourdough.</p>
