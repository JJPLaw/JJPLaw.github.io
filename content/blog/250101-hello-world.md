## A Website of My Own

I decided to start this website after reading about `D3.js` in the Data Visualization* Society magazine "Nightingale". I had just finished my job as a medical writer and wanted to do a fun visualisation project. As a simple place to start, I thought that exploring my personal dataset of album listening would be a great option because I'm fully familiar with the data (and indeed have visualised it previously).
