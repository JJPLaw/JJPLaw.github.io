<p>I decided to start this website after reading about <code>D3.js</code> in the Data Visualization* Society magazine &quot;Nightingale&quot;. I had just finished my job as a medical writer and wanted to do a fun visualisation project. As a simple place to start, I thought that exploring my personal dataset of album listening would be a great option because I'm fully familiar with the data (and indeed have visualised it previously).</p>
<p>I plan to cover the development of the visualisation more in a future post, but, briefly, I began with developing the plot in R, where I have a lot of experience with wrangling data and creating complex visualisations with <code>ggplot</code>. I wanted the visualisation to be interactive, and the native R options (like Shiny or Plotly) didn't quite suit my needs for this specific visualisation, and having recently read about <code>D3.js</code> it seemed like the perfect option.</p>
<p>With <code>D3.js</code> being inherently web-based, and my intention being to undertake further visualisation projects, I thought that having a website to display it all on would be a great resource.</p>
<h2>Choosing a framework</h2>
<p>Once I got the <code>D3.js</code> figure up and running on my single test page (after the steep learning curve of understanding <code>D3.js</code>, CSS, and HTML), I was faced with structuring up a whole website.</p>
<p>For a simple site, with only this visualisation page and a home page, I think I would have been up to the task of linking things by hand. But if I wanted multiple projects, a blog with multiple posts, etc, etc, it was going to quickly get out of hand. I also didn't want to use a website builder like Squarespace, or even pay anything at all at this early stage (though I definitely would've been able to find a Squarespace discount code from all of the podcasts I listen to/Youtube videos I watch).</p>
<p>My first and only thought for hosting the website was to use a Github pages repository, and with their Jekyll static site generator as a starting point for my final searches I landed on using Eleventy as an alternative written in a language I felt better capable of understanding.</p>
<h2>Configuring Eleventy</h2>
<p>As jumping off points for learning Eleventy, I used a combination of this blog post</p>
