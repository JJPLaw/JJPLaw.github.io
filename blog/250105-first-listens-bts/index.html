<p>I've been keeping track of the albums that I listen to for the first time since 2017. I'd recently gotten an Apple Music subscription and I was enjoying the freedom by actively seeking lots of new things. I was disappointed though with their history/record-keeping because they kept recommending me things that I'd heard before, I often couldn't remember whether I had or not. So I decided that I should just keep track myself.</p>
<p>During that first year the list was not very detailed, just the album and the artist. But as the list grew I thought it would be good to keep to start keeping more information, particularly the date, and my simple format grew in size from 2018 onwards.</p>
<p>I keep the lists on my iCloud notes, and write them in a weird little format that I find easy enough to type and read, but that can also be parsed by a computer. It follows this general format:</p>
<pre><code>Artist {
&gt; Album [comma-separated fields]
</code></pre>
<p>The comma-separated fields I currently use are date, order (starting with 'a', to track the order I heard them during that day), rating (I categorise them into a rating out of 4, with 4's having entered my music library, 3's having the potential to be in the library with a few more listens, 2's being fine, and 1's being those I actively disliked; most are 2's, with very few 1's), year released, length in minutes, and a general comment.</p>
<p>I wrote a python script to turn that text list into a CSV file, an R script to clean up and further format some of the fields (those that I would've found tricky to do in python at the time), and a bash script to automatically run these in sequence, giving me a nice formatted file to do with as I please.</p>
<h2>A Field Of Flowers</h2>
<p>I've previously visualised my album data as an artistic plot, when I hit 2,000 albums at the end of 2022:</p>

<!--<article class="col-start-7 col-span-6 sm:col-span-12 sm:margin-bottom" style='margin-top: 0'>-->
<p>Here, the lines show each month, while the height of the peak shows the number of albums in that day. I still like this style a lot, but it's much more artistic than it is informative. I never intended for the viewer to be able to tell that I listened to 4 albums on 5<sup>th</sup> February, 2020!</p>
<p>Good data visualisation should be able to tell an interesting story, but I appreciate that there's not anything particularly interesting about these data. So this time around, I wanted to make something more informative, but I still leaned into the artistic angle to give a bit of the necessary interest.</p>
